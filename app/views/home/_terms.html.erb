<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p class='word_wrap'>These are the general terms & conditions (in the following referred to as: "Agreement", "Terms and Conditions", or "Terms") for the participation in Swiftgive fundraising services provided by Vaczoway Solutions, Inc. ("Swiftgive" or "Service"), the Swiftgive website, related websites, and all of their subdomains (together, the "Website" or "Site").</p>
<p class='word_wrap'>By participating in the Service in any way, including, but not limited to, accessing the Site, viewing contributed content, or other materials on the Site, you accept the Agreement and are bound and agree to adhere to our Terms and Conditions.</p>

<h2>Description of Service</h2>

<p class='word_wrap'>Swiftgive is a fundraising platform allowing users to receive tips or donations from other users.</p>
<p class='word_wrap'>Certain individuals ("Fund Owners") create a fundraising campaign ("Fund") including description and associated email address. After a Fund is created, the Site generates a unique QR Code ("Give Code") for that particular Fund. The Give Code contains a hyperlink to a payment form for that particular Fund.  Other users ("Givers") scan a Give Code with their mobile device (using 3rd party software unaffiliated with Swiftgive), fill out the payment form which subsequently loads from the Site onto their device, and submit the form. When Givers submit a payment form, the Site builds loads a pre-populated draft email ("Payment Email") on the Giver's mobile device and the Giver completes the Payment by sending the Payment Email.</p>
<p class='word_wrap'>Payments are processed using Square Cash (http://square.com/cash), a peer-to-peer payment service offered by Square, Inc. Payments initiated using Swiftgive are  expressed agreements between a particular Giver and the owner of the email address ("Receiver") associated with a Fund (together they are "Payment Participants"). Money transferred via Payments goes directly from Giver to Receiver over the Square Cash system and is not handled by Swiftgive. Payment Participants are subject to, in addition to this Agreement, terms set forth by Square, Inc. Swiftgive has no control over Payments and is not responsible for Payment issues.</p>
<p class='word_wrap'>In order to solicit tips and donations, Users ("Fund Promoters") may also elect to purchase Swiftgive template products ("Marketing Products"), displaying that Fund's Give Code, using Zazzle (http://zazzle.com), an online product printing service offered by Zazzle Inc. In doing so, Fund Promotors, in addition to this Agreement, are subject to  terms set forth by Zazzle Inc.</p>

<h2>Fees and Charges</h2>

<p class='word_wrap'>Currently the Service is free of charge to users, but Swiftgive may modify the amount of the service or membership fees charged to users at any time and without giving reasons. Further, the Service may set individual fee structures for particular users.</p>

<p class='word_wrap'>Square Cash currently doesn't charge a fee for processing payments, in accordance to their terms, however, they may change fee structure for payments at any time. In the event of a payment fee structure change, Swiftgive is not required to communicate these changes to users.</p>

<p class='word_wrap'>Prices charged for Marketing Products are set by Zazzle and may change at any time without notice. Swiftgive is not required to give notice to users in result of marketing product price changes.</p>
